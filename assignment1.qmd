Our dataset is a list of startups getting investments from a variety of domestic and international investors. Data is gathered from KPMG and 212â€™s [Turkish Startup Investments Review 2021 report](https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/tr/pdf/2022/03/turkish-startup-investments-review-2021.pdf).

## Key Takeaways

- Top 5 sectors that are invested most in terms of total value are **Ecommerce enabler, Delivery and Logistics, Gaming, SaaS and Fintech** respectively.

- Most of the investment deals are sealed during period from **June 2021 to August 2021**

- Regarding the distribution of investments made to the target companies, first 4 startups, namely **Trendyol, Getir, Hepsiburada and Dream Games**,  attracted a total of 3.4 billion USD approximately and accounted for **89.2% of all investments made in 2021**.

- The share of local investors, with a total investment value of 273 million USD, is limited and majority of the investments are made by foreign investors with a total value of 3.5 billion USD. 

- Most of the investors by far the most are from **Turkey** in terms of *number of deals*, where as **United States, UAE and Qatar** are leading countries of investors in terms of *value* invested in startups.

### Data Preparation

Necessary data manipulation operations are made to prepare raw data for further analysis.

```{r data_prep, output = FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#read data
startup <- read_excel("startup_deals_2021.xlsx")

# Convert spaces to underscore in column names
colnames(startup) <- startup %>% 
  colnames() %>% 
  gsub(" ", "_", .)

# Convert data type of numeric columns from string to numeric
startup$`Deal_Value_(USD)` <- as.numeric(startup$`Deal_Value_(USD)`)

# Convert percentages to numeric format
startup$`Stake_(%)` <- startup$`Stake_(%)` %>% 
  gsub("\\..*", "", .) %>% 
  gsub("%", "", .) %>% 
  as.numeric()

# Convert string date to date format
startup$Announcement_Date <- startup$Announcement_Date %>% 
  paste("01", ., sep = "") %>% 
  parse_date_time(., "dmy")

# New columns for months and years
startup$year <- year(startup$Announcement_Date)
startup$month <- month(startup$Announcement_Date)
str(startup)

```

### Determining top 5 sectors in terms of total value of investments

Table below shows the top 5 sectors of startups that are invested most in total value in 2021. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}

top_5_sector_table <- startup %>% 
  group_by(Sector) %>% 
  summarize(total_value = sum(`Deal_Value_(USD)`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_value)) %>% 
  top_n(n = 5)

kable(top_5_sector_table)

```

### Visualising monthly sectoral investments to startups in 2021

Sectors are grouped as top 5 sectors and the remaining sectors are labeled as **"Others"**. As can be seen from the bar plot of monthly distribution of value of total investments, highest value of deals are sealed and announced during summer in 2021.

```{r, warning=FALSE}

# Obtaining top 5 sectors found in previous code as a vector.
top_5_sector <- top_5_sector_table %>% 
  select(Sector) %>% 
  pull()

# Create a new variable that classify sectors other than top_5 as others
startup <- startup %>% 
  mutate(group_sector = case_when(Sector %in% top_5_sector ~ Sector,!(Sector %in% top_5_sector) ~ "Other"))

# Plotting monthly investment values of top_5_sectors and others
startup %>% 
  group_by(Announcement_Date, group_sector) %>% 
  summarise(value = sum(`Deal_Value_(USD)`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Announcement_Date, y = value, fill = group_sector)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format(big.mark = ".",
                                           decimal.mark = ",")) +
  labs(x = "Deal Announcement Date", y = "Total Deal Value (USD)") + 
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete=TRUE) +
  theme_bw()
```

### Distribution of investments across target companies.

The deals accomplished in 2021 is concentrated on a few startups. 4 highest valued deals sum up to almost 90% of total value of all deals in 2021.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Obtain percentages of Target_companies in terms of value invested in 2021
# Classify companies as first 4 companies and others

startup_percent <- startup %>% 
  group_by(Target_Company) %>% 
  summarize(Total_Deal_Value = sum(`Deal_Value_(USD)`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(percent = Total_Deal_Value / sum(Total_Deal_Value) * 100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(percent)) %>% 
  mutate(group_company = case_when(Target_Company %in% Target_Company[1:4] ~ Target_Company, !(Target_Company %in% Target_Company[1:4])~"others"))

startup_percent[1:4,] %>% 
  summarize(Total_Value = sum(Total_Deal_Value), percentage = sum(percent))

# Draw a column chart according to group framework given above

startup_percent_group <- startup_percent %>% 
  group_by(group_company) %>% 
  summarize(group_percent = sum(percent, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(group_percent)) %>% 
  mutate(cum_percentage = cumsum(group_percent)) 

kable(startup_percent_group)

startup_percent_group %>% 
  arrange(group_percent) %>% 
  mutate(group_company = factor(group_company, group_company)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = group_company, y = group_percent)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#69b3a2") + 
  labs(x = "Target Company", y = "Percentage (%)", title = "Concentration of Investments among Startups in 2021") +
  theme_bw()
  
```


### Analysing Country Profile of Investors

Equal partnership in investments is assumed if number of investors is higher than one in a particular deal. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Generate Unique id for each transaction and calculate number of investors as a new column "count"
id_count <- startup %>% 
  mutate(id = 1:dim(startup)[1]) %>% 
  separate_rows(`Investor's_Origin`, sep = ", ") %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarize(id_count = n()) %>% 
  pull(id_count)

# Add id_count to startup
startup_country <- startup %>% 
  mutate(id_count) %>% 
  separate_rows(`Investor's_Origin`, sep = ", ") %>% 
  mutate(new_value = `Deal_Value_(USD)` / id_count) %>% 
  mutate(country_name = gsub(pattern = "\r\n", replacement = "", x = .$`Investor's_Origin`)) %>% 
  filter(country_name != "NA")

startup_country_graph <- startup_country %>%   
  group_by(country_name) %>% 
  summarise(country_total = sum(new_value, na.rm = TRUE), country_number = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(country_total)) %>% 
  print()

# Graph investment deals and number of transactions of highest 10 countries in 2021
startup_country_graph %>% 
  arrange(country_total) %>% 
  mutate(Country=factor(country_name, country_name)) %>%
  top_n(n = 10, wt = country_total) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Country, y = country_total)) +
  geom_col(stat = "identity", fill="#69b3a2") + 
  coord_flip() +  
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format(big.mark = ".",
                                           decimal.mark = ",")) +
  labs(y = "Total Value of Deals", title = "Value of Startup Deals in 2021 (per Investor's Origin Country)") +
  theme_bw()

startup_country_graph %>% 
  arrange(country_number) %>% 
  mutate(Country=factor(country_name, country_name)) %>%
  top_n(n = 10, wt = country_number) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Country, y = country_number)) +
  geom_col(stat="identity", fill="#69b3a2") + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(y = "Number of Deals", title = "Number of Startup Deals in 2021 (per Investor's Origin Country") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Categorizing Investors as Locals and Foreigners

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Categorizing investors as foreign and local
# Type of investors (local/foreign) as two subgroups is obtained and used for monthly investment deals.
local_foreign <- startup_country %>% 
  group_by(Announcement_Date) %>% 
  summarize(local = sum(new_value[country_name == "Turkey"], na.rm = TRUE), foreign = sum(new_value[country_name != "Turkey"], na.rm = TRUE))

local_foreign %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(local, foreign),names_to = "type", values_to = "deal_value") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = type, y = deal_value)) + 
  geom_col(stat="identity", fill="#69b3a2") +  
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format(big.mark = ".",
                                           decimal.mark = ",")) +
  labs(x = "Investor Type", y = "Total Value of Deals", title = "Domestic vs. Foreign Investment") +
  theme_bw()
```
