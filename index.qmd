## Group Project Details

Our group project is about exploration of financial status of real sector companies and their connection with macro indicators.

Shortly, our study aims to present a description of financial status of real sector companies based on their financial tables and their status of employment (labor cost, gender distribution), international trade (competitive advantage, export/import potential), growth dynamics and cost structures (producer prices).
