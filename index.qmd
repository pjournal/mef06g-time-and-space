## Group Project Details

Our group project is about exploration of financial soundness of Turkish economy based on micro data of real sector companies.

To be specific, our study aims to present an overview of financial status of real sector companies based on their financial statements such as balance sheets and income statements. Liquidity, Leverage and Profitability metrics are used to assess financial fragility/strength of the economy for the period between 2009 and 2021. In this respect, a scorecard based on derived Financial Fragility Index for each sector has been constructed to evaluate sectors comparatively. Finally, a brief analysis of sectors is presented with respect to their position in international trade.
