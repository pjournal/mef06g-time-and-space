Liquidity, Leverage and Profitability metrics are used to assess financial fragility/strength of the economy for the period between 2009 and 2021. In this respect, a scorecard based on derived Financial Fragility Index for each sector has been constructed to evaluate sectors comparatively. Finally, a brief analysis of sectors is presented with respect to their position in international trade."

    "text": "Financial Indicators\nIn this section, we introduce three main financial indicators to be used in out analysis:\n1) Liquidity Indicator:\nLiquidity is a measure of a company’s ability to pay off its short-term liabilities—those that will come due in less than a year. Current Ratio is calculated as liquidity indicator as below:\n\\(Current\\,Ratio = \\frac{Current\\,Assets}{Short\\,Term\\,Liabilities}\\)\nA higher ratio indicates the business is more capable of paying off its short-term debts. These ratios will differ according to the industry, but in general ratios from 1.5 to 2.5 is acceptable. Lower ratios could indicate liquidity problems, while higher ones could signal there may be too much working capital tied up in inventory.\n2) Leverage Indicator:\nA leverage ratio is any one of several financial measurements that look at how much capital comes in the form of debt (loans) or assesses the ability of a company to meet its financial obligations. Ratio of total loans to total assets is used in our analysis to observe the reliance on liabilities.\n\\(Leverage = \\frac{Total\\,Loans}{Total\\,Assets}\\)\n3) Profitability Indicator:\nReturn on assets (ROA) is used in our analysis as a profitability indicator which refers to a financial ratio that indicates how profitable a company is in relation to its total assets. Market participants use ROA to see how well a company uses its assets to generate profit. Our calculation is based on the formula given below:\n\\(Return\\,on\\,Assets = \\frac{Net\\,Profit}{Total\\,Assets}\\)\n\n\nCode\nbs_df_new <- bs_df %>% \n  mutate(current_ratio = bs_df$\"I-Current_assets\" / bs_df$\"III-Short-term_liabilities\", \n         leverage = bs_df$\"III-Short-term_liabilities\" / bs_df$\"Total_assets\",\n         return_on_equity = bs_df$\"net_income_is\" / bs_df$\"V-Own_funds\",\n         return_on_assets = bs_df$\"net_income_is\" / bs_df$\"Total_assets\") %>% \n  select(c(sector_code:year),c(current_ratio:return_on_assets))\n\nbs_df_new <- bs_df_new %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"current_ratio\", \"leverage\", \"return_on_equity\", \"return_on_assets\"), \n               names_to = \"Indicator\", \n               values_to = \"Value\")\n\n\n\nBasic Financial Indicators of Turkish Economy\nIn this section, sectoral averages and standard devations of financial indicators are obtained and aggregated by using total assets of each sector as weights to obtain economy level financial indicators from 2009 to 2021.\n\nReal sector firms are observed to rely more on liability sources and the economy as a whole has become more leveraged in this period.\nLiquidity position of the firms deteriorated in this period although a slight correction is observed in the last few years.\nProfitability of real sector firms stayed on the positive territory although it followed a volatile pattern throughout the period.\nInteresting point regarding variation of these indicators among different sector is that leverage of real sector firms increase in a synchronised way so that the variation of leverage indicator between sectors diminishes significantly. On the contrary, an opposite picture is prevalent for liquidity and profitability of the sectors such that the variation across sectors increases significantly.\n\n\n\nCode\n#Calculation and plot of weighted average financial indicators\nbs_df_economy <- bs_df %>% \n  mutate(current_ratio = bs_df$\"I-Current_assets\" / bs_df$\"III-Short-term_liabilities\", \n         leverage = bs_df$\"III-Short-term_liabilities\" / bs_df$\"Total_assets\",\n         return_on_equity = bs_df$\"net_income_is\" / bs_df$\"V-Own_funds\",\n         return_on_assets = bs_df$\"net_income_is\" / bs_df$\"Total_assets\") %>% \n  select(c(sector_code:year),c(current_ratio:return_on_assets), Total_assets)\n\n\nbs_df_economy_graph <- bs_df_economy %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  summarize(Liquidity = weighted.mean(current_ratio, Total_assets) * 100,\n            Leverage = weighted.mean(leverage, Total_assets) * 100,\n            Profitability = weighted.mean(return_on_assets, Total_assets) * 100)\n\nbs_df_economy_graph %>% \n  pivot_longer(-year, names_to = \"indicator_yearly\", values_to = \"value\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~indicator_yearly, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(y = \"Levels\", title = \"Weighted Average of Financial Indicators\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#Calculation and plot of standard deviation of financial indicators\nbs_df_economy %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  summarize(Liquidity = sd(current_ratio) * 10,\n            Leverage = sd(leverage) * 10,\n            Profitability = sd(return_on_assets) * 10) %>% \n  pivot_longer(-year, names_to = \"std_yearly\", values_to = \"value\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~std_yearly, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme_bw()+\n  labs(y = \"Levels\", title = \"Standard Deviation of Financial Indicators\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of financial indicators for the economy from 2009 to 2021\nA table version of the previous plots is given below.\n\n\nCode\ncolnames(bs_df_economy_graph) <- c(\"Year\", \"Liquidity\", \"Leverage\", \"Profitability\")\nbs_df_economy_graph[,2:4] <- lapply(bs_df_economy_graph[,2:4], \n                                    FUN = function(x) round(x, 2))\nkable(bs_df_economy_graph)\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nLiquidity\nLeverage\nProfitability\n\n\n\n\n2009\n132.77\n41.23\n2.98\n\n\n2010\n134.97\n41.31\n3.16\n\n\n2011\n130.74\n42.60\n1.06\n\n\n2012\n130.70\n42.72\n3.17\n\n\n2013\n128.67\n43.53\n1.74\n\n\n2014\n127.47\n43.70\n2.14\n\n\n2015\n124.81\n44.15\n1.95\n\n\n2016\n123.14\n44.52\n1.23\n\n\n2017\n123.65\n45.23\n2.56\n\n\n2018\n122.70\n46.20\n1.08\n\n\n2019\n124.03\n46.05\n2.87\n\n\n2020\n127.41\n46.52\n2.09\n\n\n2021\n128.45\n48.45\n1.83\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Series of Financial Indicators for each sector\nFinancial indicators are given for each sector below.\nConstruction, Mining, Information and Manufacturing are the sectors which have an upward trend in their liquidity position and deemed strong in terms of its level as of 2021 as compared to others.\nLeverage of real sector firms increased significantly in this period except Construction and Electricity-Gas sectors, which lowers the share of external liabilities in the financing of their assets and can be considered less risky as compared to the beginnning of the period.\nIn terms of ability to return assets into profits, winner sectors are Manufacturing, Information and Mining where as the harming effect of the COVID-19 is observed in Accomodation-Food, Entertainment and Transportation which is not surprising as these sectors are more dependent on social mobility and the recovery in the period after March-2020 is only gradual. A more benign picture can be observed in 2022 when a complete normalisation in Covid related restrictive policies has been observed. Furthermore, a consistent deterioration in the profits of Construction sector is eye-catching\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = bs_df_new[bs_df_new$Indicator == \"current_ratio\",], aes(x = year, y = Value)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Liquidity Indicator of Real Sector Companies from 2009 to 2021\", x = \"Year\") +\n  facet_wrap(~sector_name, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = bs_df_new[bs_df_new$Indicator == \"leverage\",], aes(x = year, y = Value)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Leverage Indicator of Real Sector Companies from 2009 to 2021\", x = \"Year\") +\n  facet_wrap(~sector_name, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = bs_df_new[bs_df_new$Indicator == \"return_on_assets\",], aes(x = year, y = Value)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Profitability (ROA) Indicator of Real Sector Companies from 2009 to 2021\", x = \"Year\") +\n  facet_wrap(~sector_name, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScatter Plots of Financial Indicators\nIn the previous section, one dimensional evolution of sectors in time is outlined. Having obtained indicators for financial overview of Turkish Economy on a sectoral basis, temporal relationship between them is worth analysing.\nRegarding liquidity and leverage, there exists a clear negative association which is in effect for almost all of the sectors albeit with different degrees.The exception is Mining sector which experiences rise in leverage and liquidity positions at the same time.\nFor liquidity and profitability, expected outcome is observed such that real sector firms have a better liquidity when they are more profitable for the period in consider.\nLastly, profitability and leverage indicators among sectors demonstrate a trade-off such that in general firms with lower profit encounters a decline in the share of equity as a source of financing.\n\n\nCode\nbs_df_new %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"Indicator\", values_from = \"Value\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = leverage, y = current_ratio, color = sector_name)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y~x, se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Liquidity vs Leverage\", y = \"Liquidity\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbs_df_new %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"Indicator\", values_from = \"Value\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = current_ratio, y = return_on_assets, color = sector_name)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y~x, se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Profitability vs Liquidity\", y = \"Profitability\", x = \"Liquidity\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbs_df_new %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"Indicator\", values_from = \"Value\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = leverage, y = return_on_assets, color = sector_name)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y~x, se = FALSE) + \n  labs(title = \"Profitability vs Leverage\", y = \"Profitability\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2009 - 2019 Period Average of Financial Indicators\nA closer look for the perfomance of Turkish economy in the last two years is aimed to be investigated in comparison to previous years. 2020 and 2021 is important especially for diagnosing the effect of Covid-19 outbreak and its consequent impact on the financial status of real sector firms.\nFirstly, Transportation, Accomodation-Food, Real Estate and Professional Activities are the sectors whose liquidity position deteriorate most during Covid-19. This result is not abnormal as social distancing measures and decline in mobility affect those sectors most.The rest seems to be less affected and even there are sectors who experience a considerable improvement in terms of liquidity which might be due to frequency of our data. The covid-19 outbreak started in first quarter of 2020 and then the government policies to support the economy could be one reason for the improvement of the sectors.\nSecondly, leverage indicator seemed to rise throughout the economy except a few sectors which is considered natural in response to credit oriented policies of government to support real sector firms against Covid-19 shock.\nFinally, the winners are Mining, Manufacturing, Information and Health in terms of improvement in their profits and this improvement seemed to continue in 2021. On the other end of the picture, Transportation and Services sectors were seen to be in trouble in terms of profitability.\nLiquidity Indicator\n\n\nCode\nbs_df_average <-  bs_df_new %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = Indicator, values_from = Value) %>% \n  filter(year %in% 2009:2019) %>% \n  group_by(sector_name) %>% \n  summarise(liq_ave = mean(current_ratio), lev_ave = mean(leverage), pro_ave = mean(return_on_assets))\n\nbs_df_new %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = Indicator, values_from = Value) %>% \n  filter(year %in% 2020:2021) %>% \n  select(c(sector_name, year, current_ratio)) %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = current_ratio) %>% \n  left_join(bs_df_average[,c(\"sector_name\", \"liq_ave\")], by = \"sector_name\") %>% \n  rename(\"2009_2019_average\" = \"liq_ave\") %>% \n  pivot_longer(-sector_name, names_to = \"period\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = sector_name, y = value, fill = factor(period))) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge2\")+\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(y = \"Current Ratio\", x = \"Sectors\", title = \"Liquidity Indicator\", fill = \"Years\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nLeverage Indicator\n\n\nCode\nbs_df_new %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = Indicator, values_from = Value) %>% \n  filter(year %in% 2020:2021) %>% \n  select(c(sector_name, year, leverage)) %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = leverage) %>% \n  left_join(bs_df_average[,c(\"sector_name\", \"lev_ave\")], by = \"sector_name\") %>% \n  rename(\"2009_2019_average\" = \"lev_ave\") %>% \n  pivot_longer(-sector_name, names_to = \"period\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = sector_name, y = value, fill = factor(period))) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge2\")+\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(y = \"Leverage\", x = \"Sectors\", title = \"Leverage Indicator\", fill = \"Years\") + theme_bw() \n\n\n\n\n\nProfitability Indicator\n\n\nCode\nbs_df_new %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = Indicator, values_from = Value) %>% \n  filter(year %in% 2020:2021) %>% \n  select(c(sector_name, year, return_on_assets)) %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = return_on_assets) %>% \n  left_join(bs_df_average[,c(\"sector_name\", \"pro_ave\")], by = \"sector_name\") %>% \n  rename(\"2009_2019_average\" = \"pro_ave\") %>% \n  pivot_longer(-sector_name, names_to = \"period\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = sector_name, y = value, fill = factor(period))) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge2\")+\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(y = \"Profitability\", x = \"Sectors\", title = \"Return on Assets\", fill = \"Years\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity Plots of Financial Indicators\n\n\nCode\n# Liquidity\nbs_df_new %>% pivot_wider(names_from = Indicator, values_from = Value) %>% \n  select(year, current_ratio) %>% \n  arrange(year) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = current_ratio, y = factor(year), fill = stat(quantile))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(quantile_lines = FALSE,\n                      calc_ecdf = TRUE,\n                      geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\", rel_min_height = 0.005) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(name = \"\") +\n  labs(y = \"Year\", x = \"Liquidity\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Leverage\nbs_df_new %>% pivot_wider(names_from = Indicator, values_from = Value) %>% \n  select(year, leverage) %>% \n  arrange(year) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = leverage, y = factor(year), fill = stat(quantile))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(quantile_lines = FALSE,\n                      calc_ecdf = TRUE,\n                      geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\", rel_min_height = 0.005) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(name = \"\") +\n  labs(y = \"Year\", x = \"Leverage\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Profitability\nbs_df_new %>% pivot_wider(names_from = Indicator, values_from = Value) %>% \n  select(year, return_on_assets) %>% \n  arrange(year) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = return_on_assets, y = factor(year), fill = stat(quantile))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(quantile_lines = FALSE,\n                      calc_ecdf = TRUE,\n                      geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\", rel_min_height = 0.005) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(name = \"\") + \n  labs(y = \"Year\", x = \"Return on Assets\")"

In this section, an index demonstrating financial healthiness of the sectors is constructed so that a comparative analysis of Turkish economy through time can be conducted on a holistic perspective.\nThe methodology used in the construction of Financial Fragility Index (FFI) consists of the following steps:\n1- For each financial indicator (Liquidity, Leverage and Profitability) percentile of each sector is found. To be more specific, the higher the rank of a sector, the worse it is in terms of financial soundness. In other words, for liquidity, the sector is less liquid, for leverage, the sector has higher leverage and for profitability, the sector is less profitable.\n2- After finding each sectors’ rank for each financial indicator, simple average is calculated and index value is obtained.\n3- The steps described above is repeated for each year between 2009-2021 and a time series of the index is found.\nAfter obtaining FFI, evolution of the index for each sector is illustrated in the graph below.\n\nServices sectors such as Accomodation-Food, Real Estate and Transportation have performed worse than other sectors and found themselves in a much more fragile position in terms of financial soundness\nAlthough the index alone can not be taken into account alone to conclude that a certain sector is riskier than others financially for a specific time point, time series evolution gives a glimpse of where the sectors are heading into in terms of their financial strength.\n\n\n\nCode\nbs_df_ffi <- bs_df_new %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"Indicator\", values_from = \"Value\") %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  mutate(liq_rank = percent_rank(current_ratio*-1), \n         lev_rank = percent_rank(leverage), \n         profit_rank = percent_rank(return_on_assets*-1)) %>% \n  mutate(fin_fra_index = (liq_rank + lev_rank + profit_rank)/3) %>% \n  select(-c(current_ratio:return_on_assets))\n\nbs_df_ffi %>% \n  select(c(sector_name, year, fin_fra_index)) %>% \n  pivot_longer(-c(sector_name, year), names_to = \"index\", values_to = \"value\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value)) +\n  geom_line() + \n  facet_wrap(~sector_name, scales = \"free\") + \n  labs(y = \"Financial Fragility Index\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeatmap for 2021\nFor 2021, a cross sectional analysis demonstrates that services related sectors are considered most risky in terms of financial metrics defined previously.\n\nEducation is considered most risky sector mostly due to its poor liquidity and high leverage which increases the firms’ probability of default as it raises doubts about payment of short term debts.\nMining sector is the leading sector in terms of financial soundness according to all of the predefined metrics.\n\n\n\nCode\nheatmap_df <- bs_df_economy %>% \n  filter(year == 2021) %>% \n  select(sector_name, current_ratio, leverage, return_on_assets) %>% \n  mutate(ffi = bs_df_ffi %>% select(year, sector_name, fin_fra_index) %>% filter(year == 2021) %>% pull(fin_fra_index)) %>% \n  arrange(desc(ffi)) \n\ncolnames(heatmap_df) <- c(\"Sectors\", \"Liquidity\", \"Leverage\", \"Profitability\", \"Financial Fragility Index\")\n\nheatmap_df[,2:5] <- lapply(heatmap_df[,2:5], FUN = function(x) round(x*100, 2))\n\nheatmap_df %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  data_color(columns = 'Liquidity', \n             colors = col_numeric(palette = c(\"red\", \"white\", \"green\"), \n                                  domain = c(min(heatmap_df[,2]), max(heatmap_df[,2])))) %>% \n  data_color(columns = 'Leverage', \n             colors = col_numeric(palette = c(\"green\", \"white\", \"red\"), \n                                  domain = c(min(heatmap_df[,3]), max(heatmap_df[,3])))) %>% \n  data_color(columns = 'Profitability', \n             colors = col_numeric(palette = c(\"red\", \"white\", \"green\"), \n                                  domain = c(min(heatmap_df[,4]), max(heatmap_df[,4])))) %>% \n  data_color(columns = 'Financial Fragility Index', \n             colors = col_numeric(palette = c(\"green\", \"white\", \"red\"), \n                                  domain = c(min(heatmap_df[,5]), max(heatmap_df[,5]))))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Sectors\n      Liquidity\n      Leverage\n      Profitability\n      Financial Fragility Index\n    \n  \n  \n    Education\n85.13\n62.71\n2.67\n75.00\n    Entertainment\n97.87\n54.81\n-7.14\n72.92\n    Other_Services\n101.94\n67.83\n0.73\n72.92\n    Accomodation_Food\n93.09\n44.88\n-8.47\n70.83\n    Real_Estate\n89.10\n31.88\n-14.45\n66.67\n    Administrative_Activities\n103.79\n56.77\n1.25\n62.50\n    Electricity_Gas\n94.94\n34.52\n-8.61\n60.42\n    Transportation\n105.57\n38.05\n-9.90\n58.33\n    Construction\n128.66\n53.06\n-0.40\n52.08\n    Professional_Activities\n96.05\n35.40\n-0.28\n52.08\n    Water_Supply\n120.21\n54.04\n2.45\n47.92\n    Agriculture\n123.27\n51.61\n2.26\n43.75\n    Wholesale_Retail_Trade\n131.77\n62.30\n3.46\n43.75\n    Health\n116.63\n40.70\n4.27\n33.33\n    Manufacturing\n148.98\n48.01\n7.62\n22.92\n    Information\n157.52\n36.48\n7.10\n14.58\n    Mining\n166.78\n28.28\n14.86\n0.00\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Trade\n\n\nCode\ntrade_df_new <- \n  trade_df %>% \n  mutate(net_export = (export -

    "text": "Key Takeaways\n\nReal sector firms are observed to rely more on liability sources and the economy as a whole has become more leveraged in this period, which is considered a natural result of credit oriented policies for the last decade in the Turkish Economy.\nLiquidity position of the firms deteriorated in this period although a slight correction is observed in the last few years. Transportation, Accomodation-Food, Real Estate and Professional Activities are the sectors whose liquidity position deteriorate most during Covid-19.\nProfitability of real sector firms stayed on the positive territory although it followed a volatile pattern throughout the period. During Covid-19, the winners are Mining, Manufacturing, Information and Health in terms of improvement in their profits and this improvement seemed to continue in 2021. On the opposite end of the picture, Transportation and Services sectors were seen to be in trouble in terms of profitability.\nLeverage of real sector firms increase in a synchronised way whereas variation across sectors increases significantly for liquidity and profitability indicators.\nFor 2021, a cross sectional analysis demonstrates that services related sectors are considered most risky in terms of financial metrics defined. To be specific, Education is considered most risky sector mostly due to its poor liquidity and high leverage which increases the firms’ probability of default as it raises doubts about payment of short term debts."

Current Ratio is calculated as liquidity indicator as below:\n\\(Current\\,Ratio = \\frac{Current\\,Assets}{Short\\,Term\\,Liabilities}\\)\nA higher ratio indicates the business is more capable of paying off its short-term debts. These ratios will differ according to the industry, but in general ratios from 1.5 to 2.5 is acceptable. Lower ratios could indicate liquidity problems, while higher ones could signal there may be too much working capital tied up in inventory.\n2) Leverage Indicator:\nA leverage ratio is any one of several financial measurements that look at how much capital comes in the form of debt (loans) or assesses the ability of a company to meet its financial obligations. Ratio of total loans to total assets is used in our analysis to observe the reliance on liabilities.\n\\(Leverage = \\frac{Total\\,Loans}{Total\\,Assets}\\)\n3) Profitability Indicator:\nReturn on assets (ROA) is used in our analysis as a profitability indicator which refers to a financial ratio that indicates how profitable a company is in relation to its total assets. Market participants use ROA to see how well a company uses its assets to generate profit. Our calculation is based on the formula given below:\n\\(Return\\,on\\,Assets = \\frac{Net\\,Profit}{Total\\,Assets}\\)\n\nGeneral Overview\nReal sector firms are observed to rely more on liability sources and the economy as a whole has become more leveraged in this period, which is considered a natural result of credit oriented policies for the last decade in the Turkish Economy.\nLiquidity position of the firms deteriorated in this period although a slight correction is observed in the last few years.\nProfitability of real sector firms stayed on the positive territory although it followed a volatile pattern throughout the period.\n\n\nCode\n#Calculation and plot of weighted average financial indicators\nbs_df_economy <- bs_df %>% \n  mutate(current_ratio = bs_df$\"I-Current_assets\" / bs_df$\"III-Short-term_liabilities\", \n         leverage = bs_df$\"III-Short-term_liabilities\" / bs_df$\"Total_assets\",\n         return_on_equity = bs_df$\"net_income_is\" / bs_df$\"V-Own_funds\",\n         return_on_assets = bs_df$\"net_income_is\" / bs_df$\"Total_assets\") %>% \n  select(c(sector_code:year),c(current_ratio:return_on_assets), Total_assets)\n\n\nbs_df_economy_graph <- bs_df_economy %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  summarize(Liquidity = weighted.mean(current_ratio, Total_assets) * 100,\n            Leverage = weighted.mean(leverage, Total_assets) * 100,\n            Profitability = weighted.mean(return_on_assets, Total_assets) * 100)\n\nbs_df_economy_graph %>% \n  pivot_longer(-year, names_to = \"indicator_yearly\", values_to = \"value\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~indicator_yearly, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(y = \"Levels\", title = \"Weighted Average of Financial Indicators\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#Calculation and plot of standard deviation of financial indicators\nbs_df_economy %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  summarize(Liquidity = sd(current_ratio) * 10,\n            Leverage = sd(leverage) * 10,\n            Profitability = sd(return_on_assets) * 10) %>% \n  pivot_longer(-year, names_to = \"std_yearly\", values_to = \"value\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~std_yearly, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme_bw()+\n  labs(y = \"Levels\", title = \"Standard Deviation of Financial Indicators\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSectoral Overview\nConstruction, Mining, Information and Manufacturing are the sectors which have an upward trend in their liquidity position and deemed strong in terms of its level as of 2021 as compared to others.\nLeverage of real sector firms increased significantly in this period except Construction and Electricity-Gas sectors, which lowers the share of external liabilities in the financing of their assets and can be considered less risky as compared to the beginnning of the period.\nIn terms of ability to return assets into profits, winner sectors are Manufacturing, Information and Mining where as the harming effect of the COVID-19 is observed in Accomodation-Food, Entertainment and Transportation which is not surprising as these sectors are more dependent on social mobility and the recovery in the period after March-2020 is only gradual. A more benign picture can be observed in 2022 when a complete normalisation in Covid related restrictive policies has been observed. Furthermore, a consistent deterioration in the profits of Construction sector is eye-catching.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = bs_df_new[bs_df_new$Indicator == \"current_ratio\",], aes(x = year, y = Value)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Liquidity Indicator of Real Sector Companies from 2009 to 2021\", x = \"Year\") +\n  facet_wrap(~sector_name, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = bs_df_new[bs_df_new$Indicator == \"leverage\",], aes(x = year, y = Value)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Leverage Indicator of Real Sector Companies from 2009 to 2021\", x = \"Year\") +\n  facet_wrap(~sector_name, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = bs_df_new[bs_df_new$Indicator == \"return_on_assets\",], aes(x = year, y = Value)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Profitability (ROA) Indicator of Real Sector Companies from 2009 to 2021\", x = \"Year\") +\n  facet_wrap(~sector_name, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity plots make it possible to observe complete distribution of indicators among sectors in a specific year. In the plots below, distributions are segmented by colors with respect to 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles where white shaded region denotes sectors that are below the 25th percentile and dark blue region corresponds to sectors above 75th percentile of the distribution with respect to the financial indicator.\nFor liquidity, the distribution seems to became right skewed at the end of 2021 vs its left skewed shape back in 2009 which implies that firms’ liquidity position decreases on average while there exists sectors that are in a stronger position in terms of liquidity.\nFor leverage, aside from increasing median leverage among sectors, no significant change in the shape of the distribution is observed.\nFor profitability, the obvious picture is that deviation of profitability across sectors increased considerably. Pandemic shock resulted in higher portion of sectors within the economy incurring higher net losses in 2020 as compared to 2019. Although a rebound is expected in profitability of sectors in 2021, distribution presents a different picture where a clear separation between sectors exist such that sectors in loss at the end of 2020 incur higher losses. On the other hand, the gains of some sectors increased comparatively higher in this period and the distribution became flat with outliers in the both end.\n\n\nCode\n# Liquidity\nbs_df_new %>% pivot_wider(names_from = Indicator, values_from = Value) %>% \n  select(year, current_ratio) %>% \n  arrange(year) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = current_ratio, y = factor(year), fill = stat(quantile))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(quantile_lines = FALSE,\n                      calc_ecdf = TRUE,\n                      geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\", rel_min_height = 0.005) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(name = \"\") +\n  labs(y = \"Year\", x = \"Liquidity\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Leverage\nbs_df_new %>% pivot_wider(names_from = Indicator, values_from = Value) %>% \n  select(year, leverage) %>% \n  arrange(year) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = leverage, y = factor(year), fill = stat(quantile))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(quantile_lines = FALSE,\n                      calc_ecdf = TRUE,\n                      geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\", rel_min_height = 0.005) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(name = \"\") +\n  labs(y = \"Year\", x = \"Leverage\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Profitability\nbs_df_new %>% pivot_wider(names_from = Indicator, values_from = Value) %>% \n  select(year, return_on_assets) %>% \n  arrange(year) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = return_on_assets, y = factor(year), fill = stat(quantile))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(quantile_lines = FALSE,\n                      calc_ecdf = TRUE,\n                      geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\", rel_min_height = 0.005) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(name = \"\") + \n  labs(y = \"Year\", x = \"Return on Assets\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovid-19 Shock and Sectoral Financial Developments\nA closer look for the perfomance of Turkish economy in the last two years is aimed to be investigated in comparison to previous years. 2020 and 2021 is important especially for diagnosing the effect of Covid-19 outbreak and its consequent impact on the financial status of real sector firms.\nFirstly, Transportation, Accomodation-Food, Real Estate and Professional Activities are the sectors whose liquidity position deteriorate most during Covid-19. This result is not abnormal as social distancing measures and decline in mobility affect those sectors most.The rest seems to be less affected and even there are sectors who experience a considerable improvement in terms of liquidity which might be due to frequency of our data. The covid-19 outbreak started in first quarter of 2020 and then the government policies to support the economy could be one reason for the improvement of the sectors.\nSecondly, leverage indicator seemed to rise throughout the economy except a few sectors which is considered natural in response to credit oriented policies of government to support real sector firms against Covid-19 shock.\nFinally, the winners are Mining, Manufacturing, Information and Health in terms of improvement in their profits and this improvement seemed to continue in 2021. On the other end of the picture, Transportation and Services sectors were seen to be in trouble in terms of profitability.\n\n\nCode\n#Liquidity Indicator\nbs_df_average <-  bs_df_new %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = Indicator, values_from = Value) %>% \n  filter(year %in% 2009:2019) %>% \n  group_by(sector_name) %>% \n  summarise(liq_ave = mean(current_ratio), lev_ave = mean(leverage), pro_ave = mean(return_on_assets))\n\nbs_df_new %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = Indicator, values_from = Value) %>% \n  filter(year %in% 2020:2021) %>% \n  select(c(sector_name, year, current_ratio)) %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = current_ratio) %>% \n  left_join(bs_df_average[,c(\"sector_name\", \"liq_ave\")], by = \"sector_name\") %>% \n  rename(\"2009_2019_average\" = \"liq_ave\") %>% \n  pivot_longer(-sector_name, names_to = \"period\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = sector_name, y = value, fill = factor(period))) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge2\")+\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(y = \"Current Ratio\", x = \"Sectors\", title = \"Liquidity Indicator\", fill = \"Years\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#Leverage Indicator\nbs_df_new %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = Indicator, values_from = Value) %>% \n  filter(year %in% 2020:2021) %>% \n  select(c(sector_name, year, leverage)) %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = leverage) %>% \n  left_join(bs_df_average[,c(\"sector_name\", \"lev_ave\")], by = \"sector_name\") %>% \n  rename(\"2009_2019_average\" = \"lev_ave\") %>% \n  pivot_longer(-sector_name, names_to = \"period\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = sector_name, y = value, fill = factor(period))) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge2\")+\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(y = \"Leverage\", x = \"Sectors\", title = \"Leverage Indicator\", fill = \"Years\") + theme_bw() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#Profitability Indicator\nbs_df_new %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = Indicator, values_from = Value) %>% \n  filter(year %in% 2020:2021) %>% \n  select(c(sector_name, year, return_on_assets)) %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = return_on_assets) %>% \n  left_join(bs_df_average[,c(\"sector_name\", \"pro_ave\")], by = \"sector_name\") %>% \n  rename(\"2009_2019_average\" = \"pro_ave\") %>% \n  pivot_longer(-sector_name, names_to = \"period\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = sector_name, y = value, fill = factor(period))) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge2\")+\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(y = \"Profitability\", x = \"Sectors\", title = \"Return on Assets\", fill = \"Years\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Fragility Index (FFI)\nUp until now, financial position of Turkish economy is evaluated based on the three indicators obtained through balance sheets and income statements of sectors.

To be more specific, the higher the rank of a sector, the worse it is in terms of financial soundness. In other words, for liquidity, the sector is less liquid, for leverage, the sector has higher leverage and for profitability, the sector is less profitable.\nAfter finding each sectors’ rank for each financial indicator, simple average is calculated and index value is obtained.\nThe steps described above is repeated for each year between 2009-2021 and a time series of the index is found.\n\nAlthough the index alone can not be taken into account alone to conclude that a certain sector is riskier than others financially for a specific time point, time series evolution gives a glimpse of where the sectors are heading into in terms of their financial strength.\nServices sectors such as Accomodation-Food, Real Estate and Transportation have performed worse than other sectors and found themselves in a much more fragile position in terms of financial soundness.\n\n\nCode\nbs_df_ffi <- bs_df_new %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"Indicator\", values_from = \"Value\") %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  mutate(liq_rank = percent_rank(current_ratio*-1), \n         lev_rank = percent_rank(leverage), \n         profit_rank = percent_rank(return_on_assets*-1)) %>% \n  mutate(fin_fra_index = (liq_rank + lev_rank + profit_rank)/3) %>% \n  select(-c(current_ratio:return_on_assets))\n\nbs_df_ffi %>% \n  select(c(sector_name, year, fin_fra_index)) %>% \n  pivot_longer(-c(sector_name, year), names_to = \"index\", values_to = \"value\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value)) +\n  geom_line() + \n  facet_wrap(~sector_name, scales = \"free\") + \n  labs(y = \"Financial Fragility Index\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFFI Scorecard for 2021\nFor 2021, a cross sectional analysis demonstrates that services related sectors are considered most risky in terms of financial metrics defined previously.\n\nEducation is considered most risky sector mostly due to its poor liquidity and high leverage which increases the firms’ probability of default as it raises doubts about payment of short term debts.\nMining sector is the leading sector in terms of financial soundness according to all of the predefined metrics.\n\n\n\nCode\nheatmap_df <- bs_df_economy %>% \n  filter(year == 2021) %>% \n  select(sector_name, current_ratio, leverage, return_on_assets) %>% \n  mutate(ffi = bs_df_ffi %>% select(year, sector_name, fin_fra_index) %>% filter(year == 2021) %>% pull(fin_fra_index)) %>% \n  arrange(desc(ffi)) \n\ncolnames(heatmap_df) <- c(\"Sectors\", \"Liquidity\", \"Leverage\", \"Profitability\", \"Financial Fragility Index\")\n\nheatmap_df[,2:5] <- lapply(heatmap_df[,2:5], FUN = function(x) round(x*100, 2))\n\nheatmap_df %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  data_color(columns = 'Liquidity', \n             colors = col_numeric(palette = c(\"red\", \"white\", \"green\"), \n                                  domain = c(min(heatmap_df[,2]), max(heatmap_df[,2])))) %>% \n  data_color(columns = 'Leverage', \n             colors = col_numeric(palette = c(\"green\", \"white\", \"red\"), \n                                  domain = c(min(heatmap_df[,3]), max(heatmap_df[,3])))) %>% \n  data_color(columns = 'Profitability', \n             colors = col_numeric(palette = c(\"red\", \"white\", \"green\"), \n                                  domain = c(min(heatmap_df[,4]), max(heatmap_df[,4])))) %>% \n  data_color(columns = 'Financial Fragility Index', \n             colors = col_numeric(palette = c(\"green\", \"white\", \"red\"), \n                                  domain = c(min(heatmap_df[,5]), max(heatmap_df[,5]))))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Sectors\n      Liquidity\n      Leverage\n      Profitability\n      Financial Fragility Index\n    \n  \n  \n    Education\n85.13\n62.71\n2.67\n75.00\n    Entertainment\n97.87\n54.81\n-7.14\n72.92\n    Other_Services\n101.94\n67.83\n0.73\n72.92\n    Accomodation_Food\n93.09\n44.88\n-8.47\n70.83\n    Real_Estate\n89.10\n31.88\n-14.45\n66.67\n    Administrative_Activities\n103.79\n56.77\n1.25\n62.50\n    Electricity_Gas\n94.94\n34.52\n-8.61\n60.42\n    Transportation\n105.57\n38.05\n-9.90\n58.33\n    Construction\n128.66\n53.06\n-0.40\n52.08\n    Professional_Activities\n96.05\n35.40\n-0.28\n52.08\n    Water_Supply\n120.21\n54.04\n2.45\n47.92\n    Agriculture\n123.27\n51.61\n2.26\n43.75\n    Wholesale_Retail_Trade\n131.77\n62.30\n3.46\n43.75\n    Health\n116.63\n40.70\n4.27\n33.33\n    Manufacturing\n148.98\n48.01\n7.62\n22.92\n    Information\n157.52\n36.48\n7.10\n14.58\n    Mining\n166.78\n28.28\n14.86\n0.00\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes International Trade Matter for Financial Strength?\nTradable sectors are determined with respect to their trade volume such that “Agriculture”, “Manufacturing”, “Mining”, “Water_Supply” are considered in this group with highest trade volume. The rest is grouped as Non-Tradable sectors.\nTwo groups are compared with respect to financial fragility index. Sectors that are more export/import oriented are found to be less vulnerable where as non-tradable sectors that has higher exposure to local markets are considered to be riskier.\n\n\nCode\ntradables <- c(\"Agriculture\", \"Manufacturing\", \"Mining\", \"Water_Supply\")\n\ndf_fin <- df_fin %>% inner_join(bs_df_ffi %>% select(sector_name, year, fin_fra_index), by = c(\"sector_name\", \"year\"))\n\ndf_fin %>% \n  select(-sector_code, -group) %>% \n  mutate(trade_group = ifelse(sector_name %in% tradables, \"tradable\", \"non_tradable\")) %>% \n  group_by(year, trade_group) %>% \n  summarize(financial_fragility_index = mean(fin_fra_index)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(year, financial_fragility_index, color = trade_group)) + \n  geom_line() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Financial Fragility Index\")"
